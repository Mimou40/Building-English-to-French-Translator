# Building-English-to-French-Translator

## Overview

This project involves building an English to French translator using a dataset of English-French sentence pairs. The project leverages deep learning techniques to train a sequence-to-sequence model capable of translating English sentences into French.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of English and French sentence pairs, stored in a tab-separated file (fra.txt). The dataset includes the following columns:

- en: English sentences.
- fr: French translations of the corresponding English sentences.
The dataset is preprocessed and shuffled to ensure effective training.

## Features
- Sequence-to-Sequence Model: Utilizes a neural network architecture that translates English sentences into French.
- Attention Mechanism: Implements an attention mechanism to improve translation accuracy by focusing on relevant parts of the input sentence.
- Data Augmentation: Includes data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of the model.
## Project Structure
- Building_English_to_French_translator.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the English to French translator.
- fra.txt: Dataset containing English-French sentence pairs.
- requirements.txt: A list of Python libraries required to run the project.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
